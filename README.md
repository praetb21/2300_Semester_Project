# 2300_Semester_Project

**Project Name:** Military Vehicle Database  
**Team name:** Praet Industries  
**Team member:** Brandon Praet 


**Who:** 
I'm Brandon Praet, with nearly 5 years of experience as a regulatory automotive engineer, I chose to do this project solo to develop my skills in Java programming. 
  
**What:** 
A military vehicle database to store information on real-world military vehicles, including attributes like: 
- Name
- Manufacturer
- Cost

A GUI to interact with the information
- Add new vehicles
- Remove existing vehicles
  
**Why:** 
Primarily, for those interested in working in the defesne industry to learn more about employers in the area and their products.

**How will it be used / What it will be used for:**  
The vehicle database will act as a repository of information that can be added to and browsed by the user.

**Aspirational Goals:** 
I want to be realistic regarding my coding ability and start with the simplist implementation first, however, these functions are what I initially imagined when drafting this project's proposal:

1. Implement a "Defense Company Database" storing company names, location, services or products they provide. This seems like a manageable goal, and would add value
   
2. Implement a "Battle simulator" to demonstrate the advantages/disadvantages of various vehicles and their cost.

**Disclaimer:** This project does not endorse violence. It is an objective exploration of local industry and the strategic factors they consider, serving as an educational tool above all else.
