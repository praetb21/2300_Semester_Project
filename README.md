# 2300_Semester_Project

**Project Name:** Military Simulator  
**Team name:** Praet Industries  
**Team member:** Brandon Praet 


**Who:** 
My name is Brandon Praet, I have almost 5 years of experience as a regulatory automotive engineer. Currently, I am pursuing a master's degree in Software Engineering and IT at Oakland University. I chose to do the project solo to develop my skills in Java programming. 
  
**What:** 
This project will create a "Military Simulator" consisting of 
1. A militrary vehicle database containing information about real world military vehicles, whose attributes will be "gamefied" into stats such as attack, defense, speed, range, cost.
2. A "simulation" that uses mathmatical calculations to demonstrate the effectiveness of various unit compositions an their interaction with opposing units. Users will observe how low-cost drones disrupt traditional heavy-armor tactics or how logistics vehicles support combat vehicles.
  
**Why:** 
1. To build knowledge of Michigan's defense industry, including key manufacturers and their products.
2. To explore the intricacies of modern military strategy, particularly how it may be affected by emerging technologies like drones, as well as to highlight the importance of logistics and support vehicles.
    
**How will it be used / What it will be used for:**  
- The vehicle database will educate users about Michigan-based manufacturers and their contributions to the defense industry
- The "simulation" will provide an interactive way for users to experiment with unit compositions and observe the effects on battlefield outcomes.


  

**Disclaimer:** This project is not an endorsement of violence. Its purpose is to take an objective view at local industry and the challenges they face.
